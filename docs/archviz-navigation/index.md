Thank you for purchasing the ArchViz Navigation Template! This comprehensive navigation system is designed specifically for architectural visualization projects with support for both desktop and mobile platforms.

## Overview

The project is broken down into two main templates:

- **Basic Navigation**: Perfect for single focus assets ranging in scale from an object to a building
- **Advanced Navigation**: Ideal for larger scale projects like neighbourhood or city explorers

All navigation is set up for Desktop and mobile use out of the box. Touch screens are automatically detected, and the system is built with Pixel Streaming scenarios in mind where the end user could be on either desktop or mobile.

## Key Features

- **Dual Navigation Modes**: Switch between third-person and first-person perspectives
- **Camera Animations**: Smooth transitions between camera modes
- **Selection System**: Hover to highlight and select objects with automatic camera focus
- **Mobile Ready**: Automatic touch screen detection and mobile controls
- **Pixel Streaming Optimized**: Built specifically for streaming scenarios
